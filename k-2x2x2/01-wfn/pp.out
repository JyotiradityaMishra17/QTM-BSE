     Parallel version (MPI), running on     1 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     19679 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts


     Reading xml data from directory:

     ./silicon.save/

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
